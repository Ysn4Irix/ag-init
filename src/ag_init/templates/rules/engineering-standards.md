Project-wide instructions for AI coding agents. These rules apply unless a more specific, applicable instruction in a subdirectory overrides them. Follow repository conventions and the project's actual technology stack; do not assume tools or capabilities that are not present.

## 1. Core Principles

- Prioritize correctness, security, maintainability, accessibility, and a professional user experience.
- Understand the project before changing it. Prefer the smallest reliable change that fully addresses the task.
- Preserve existing behavior unless the requested change explicitly requires otherwise.
- Do not invent requirements, functionality, APIs, configuration, or successful test results.
- Do not perform destructive, externally visible, or irreversible actions without explicit user authorization.
- If instructions conflict, follow the most specific applicable instruction; ask when the conflict materially affects the result.

## 2. Project Understanding

- Before implementation, inspect the project structure, `README.md`, relevant documentation, configuration, dependencies, and affected code.
- Identify the framework, language, package manager, architecture, existing patterns, and available scripts from the repository itself.
- Check for existing utilities, components, services, and tests before creating new ones.
- Follow established project conventions unless they are demonstrably unsafe or unsuitable.
- Do not rewrite working systems, migrate frameworks, or introduce architectural changes without a clear requirement and explanation.

## 3. Development Workflow

1. Understand the request, constraints, and expected behavior.
2. Inspect the relevant implementation and identify affected areas.
3. For substantial work, outline a concise implementation plan before editing.
4. Implement in focused, coherent changes.
5. Verify the result using the relevant tests and quality checks.
6. Update affected documentation and report the outcome.

- Keep changes scoped to the task; avoid unrelated cleanup and formatting churn.
- Preserve compatibility with existing data, interfaces, and integrations unless a breaking change is requested.
- Consider loading, empty, success, validation, error, and edge states where relevant.
- Ask a concise clarifying question only when a missing decision materially blocks safe implementation. Otherwise, use a conservative, clearly stated assumption.
- Do not stop at a visual mock-up or placeholder when working functionality was requested.

## 4. Architecture & Code Quality

- Write clear, modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
- Keep responsibilities separated and functions/components focused.
- Apply SOLID principles and established design patterns where they improve the solution; avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- Prefer readable code over clever or excessively compressed implementations.
- Use consistent naming, formatting, and conventions already established by the project.
- Use the strongest practical typing supported by the stack. Avoid `any`, unsafe casts, broad suppressions, and disabled checks unless justified and documented.
- Avoid duplicated logic, oversized modules, hidden side effects, and unnecessary global state.
- Reuse existing abstractions when appropriate; do not create generic frameworks for one-off needs.
- Remove unused code, temporary files, debug statements, and abandoned implementations introduced by the task.
- Do not leave TODOs, stubs, fake data, or nonfunctional controls in completed production features unless explicitly requested and clearly identified.

## 5. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Add or update tests when behavior changes; prioritize meaningful coverage of business logic and critical user flows.
- Cover relevant boundary conditions, invalid input, failure paths, and permission cases.
- Run the applicable tests, linting, formatting checks, type checks, and production build when available and relevant.
- Fix regressions and issues introduced by the changes.
- Do not weaken, delete, skip, or bypass tests or quality checks merely to obtain a passing result.
- Never claim a check passed unless it was actually executed and passed.
- If a check cannot be run, state what was not run and why.
- Do not claim complete verification based only on a successful build.

## 6. Security & Privacy

- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, tokens, private certificates, or other secrets.
- Use environment variables or the project's approved secret-management mechanism; update example configuration without including real secrets.
- Validate untrusted input at appropriate boundaries and enforce authorization on the server, not only in the client.
- Apply least privilege and secure defaults.
- Protect personal, confidential, and business data in storage, transport, logs, exports, and error responses.
- Avoid exposing stack traces, secrets, internal paths, or sensitive implementation details to end users.
- Use parameterized database operations and safe output encoding appropriate to the stack.
- Review authentication, session handling, access control, file handling, and external integrations for security implications.
- Do not introduce telemetry, advertising trackers, or data sharing beyond the project's documented requirements.
- Do not run destructive database, filesystem, infrastructure, or account operations without explicit authorization.

## 7. UI/UX & Accessibility

- Follow the project's established design system. Keep typography, spacing, colors, icons, and component behavior consistent.
- Build responsive interfaces appropriate to the product's target devices; prioritize mobile usability when the project is mobile-first.
- Use semantic structure, accessible names, keyboard navigation, visible focus, and sufficient contrast.
- Do not rely on color alone to communicate meaning.
- Provide appropriate loading, empty, success, validation, disabled, and error states.
- Make controls behave predictably and provide clear feedback for user actions.
- Avoid unnecessary decoration, visual clutter, excessive cards, gradients, and inconsistent component styles.
- Do not add decorative badges, pills, chips, or tag-shaped labels. Use them only for meaningful dynamic statuses, alerts, counts, or genuine selectable interactions.
- During UI reviews, identify and remove decorative UI that does not provide clear user value.
- Follow platform conventions and respect reduced-motion preferences where applicable.
- Never wrap ordinary metadata, technology names, database types, framework names, feature descriptions, or informational labels in a colored or rounded container.
- Render this information as plain text, subtle secondary text, or within an existing content row.
- Use badges only for meaningful dynamic statuses, alerts, counts, or other cases where visual emphasis provides clear user value.
- Use interactive chips only for genuine user interactions, such as selectable filters.
- Do not introduce new badge variants or badge components merely to decorate a screen.
- Apply this rule consistently across all screens, components, dialogs, cards, and future features.
- When uncertain, choose plain text over a badge.
- During UI reviews, actively identify and remove unnecessary badges from both new and existing interfaces.

## 8. Error Handling, Logging & Reliability

- Handle errors explicitly and consistently; never silently swallow meaningful failures.
- Show users actionable, appropriately worded messages without exposing sensitive details.
- Use the project's logging conventions and structured logging where supported.
- Do not log credentials, tokens, personal data, or sensitive request payloads.
- Handle asynchronous work, cancellation, retries, timeouts, and resource cleanup appropriately.
- Avoid retry behavior that can duplicate non-idempotent operations.
- Preserve data integrity and provide safe recovery behavior where relevant.

## 9. Dependencies & Configuration

- Prefer existing dependencies and native platform capabilities.
- Add a dependency only when its value justifies its maintenance, security, licensing, and bundle/runtime costs.
- Check compatibility, maintenance status, license, and known security concerns before adding or upgrading packages.
- Use the repository's existing package manager and lockfile. Do not mix package managers.
- Avoid unnecessary dependency upgrades and do not modify lockfiles by hand.
- Keep configuration consistent across development, test, and production environments.
- Document new environment variables and provide safe example values; never commit actual secrets.

## 10. Performance

- Avoid unnecessary rendering, computation, network requests, database queries, and large dependencies.
- Use pagination, caching, batching, and lazy loading when appropriate to actual usage and architecture.
- Consider performance on the project's target devices and network conditions.
- Measure or identify a concrete bottleneck before introducing complex optimization.
- Prioritize correctness and maintainability; avoid premature optimization.

## 11. Documentation

- Keep documentation accurate and synchronized with implemented behavior.
- Update setup, usage, configuration, architecture, and troubleshooting documentation when affected.
- Document non-obvious decisions, important constraints, and operational procedures.
- Never describe planned or placeholder functionality as implemented.
- Keep Markdown documentation in `docs/`, except essential root-level files required by tools or platforms, including `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` `CHANGELOG.md` etc..
- Use the repository's existing documentation naming and organization conventions where possible.

## 12. Definition of Done

A task is complete when, as applicable:

- The requested behavior is implemented and matches the requirements.
- Existing functionality and data compatibility are preserved.
- Relevant tests and quality checks have been run and their results are known.
- Security, accessibility, responsive behavior, and error states have been considered.
- Related documentation and configuration examples are updated.
- No unintended files, temporary code, debug output, or unrelated changes remain.
- Remaining limitations, assumptions, and follow-up work are clearly disclosed.

## 13. Agent Completion Report

At the end of implementation work, provide a concise report containing:

- **Implemented:** What changed and why.
- **Files:** The important files created or modified.
- **Verification:** Checks actually run and their results.
- **Limitations:** Known issues, checks not run, and remaining work.
- **Git:** Local commit hash/message if a commit was created; explicitly state that no remote push or publication was performed.
